# Mutatio

> UI Photo Editor

## Purpose of Project

Tool to personalize photos by adding filters and personal content in foreground.

## Example of Use

Sonia is a poetry writer and she likes to associate words with good images.
She found in *Mutatio* the right tool to personalize the next photo she wants to post on her social media profile. 

Once opened the tool she *uploads the image* to visualize it in the dashboard. 
Then she selects the best *preset colored filters* that look fabulous with that image.
In the left side of the page, she found a *text editor* where she can write her poetry. 
She knows that she can add style using *markdown* rules and *positioning the content* in the picture where she likes most.

Once she's happy with the result can finally *add her watermark* to the photo and click the button to *download the final product* and publish it.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS 
- JavaScript
- Vue.js
- html2canvas


## What I Learn
I learned the basics of *Vue.js* and how to use *Component* features.  
I implemented a *Markdown editor* in order to allow users to add a content in the image.  
I used the library *html2canvas* to transform the image container with the text into a *canvas* in order to take a screenshot and download the final result.
